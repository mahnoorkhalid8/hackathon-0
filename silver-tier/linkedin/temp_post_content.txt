Here's what most small businesses get wrong about AI automation:

❌ They think it's too expensive
❌ They believe it's only for large companies
❌ They assume it requires technical expertise

The truth?

✅ AI automation pays for itself within 3-6 months
✅ Small businesses see the biggest ROI
✅ Modern solutions are plug-and-play

The companies that embrace AI automation early gain a massive competitive advantage.

The ones that wait? They're left playing catch-up.

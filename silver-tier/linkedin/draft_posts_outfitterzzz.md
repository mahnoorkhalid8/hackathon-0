3 ways to extend the life of your outdoor gear:

1. **Clean After Every Use**
Dirt and moisture are your gear's worst enemies. A quick clean adds years to equipment life.

2. **Store Properly**
Dry, cool, and away from direct sunlight. Proper storage prevents 80% of gear degradation.

3. **Regular Maintenance**
Small repairs now prevent big replacements later. Check zippers, seams, and straps monthly.
